Please find the details below: This master’s thesis is funded by an EU funded project. According to the consortium agreements, codesharing is only permitted with the involved parties, which unfortunately does not apply to THWS.Additionally, as per Bosch rules (also included in the contract), it is highly unlikely we can open accessthe code. In case of consortium rules, there might be a possibility to open-access code only after 3-5years following the end of the consortium contract i.e., around 2029 or 2031. Bosch however has stricterrules regarding this and as I understand, the code would belong to Bosch. Regarding possibility of journal publication, it typically requires at least a year’s work to achieve qualityresults. In case of a master thesis, generally, we don’t see that quality of results that could technicallyfruition to journal articles within 6 months. A workshop paper I imagine could be feasible, depending onthe outcome of the thesis and approval from the higher body within our department. I believe it is crucial to be transparent from the beginning to avoid any misunderstandings regardingexpectations and outcomes. Taking these things into consideration please let me know if these requirementsare still feasible or if we need to rethink the contract. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

You rightly understood that this may be a critical point. Unfortunately, companystandard protecting their own company interests often go against academic rules protecting the interests of thestudents. As for publication, I totally agree that it is very difficult if not outright impossible to reach within 6 monthssufficiently good results so that the outcomes can be published within a journal. And I totally understand and agreethat if the work were to be turned into a journal publication, more people from the project (I guess primarily fromBosch but perhaps also from Eidhoven) need to be involved. And this could easily take 12 months or more. Whetherthe outcomes could be good enough for a workshop is also questionable but even then, Bosch and Eidhovencollaborators would need to get involved. Both of these scenarios are, however, fairly irrelevant for the Master thesisitself and we do not really need to discuss them at this point. They will only become relevant if the outcomes aretruly excellent and one of the involved parties is interested in pursuing the journal/workshop publication.So on this point, I think we totally agree and journal/workshop publication is by no means acondition for Aniket's master thesisAniket cannot, however, finish his Master's program simply through an internship for Boschwithout having anything in his hands in the end. By the rules of the THWS, Aniket has to deliver aMaster thesis which has to be a result of his independent scientific work.Nevertheless, since the Master thesis is still part of Aniket's educational process, he obviouslydoes not have to work on it completely alone but it is expect he delivers it under a supervision. Ifthis supervision comes from a company due to Aniket's involvement in a bigger project, evenbetter. But Aniket still needs to finish with a document in the end which has been fully developedby him as the single author taking full responsibility for its content. Strictly speaking this meansthat neither I nor you can \"tell\" Aniket what to write. We can \"advice\" him, but it is his decision ifand how he does it.In case of company driven project, the rules are similar with the fundamental difference that thecompany can tell Aniket what NOT to write about and what CANNOT be included in themanuscript because it relates to sensitive company (or partner) information. For example, thecode could be an example of such a restriction (though I personally still very much disagree for aMaster thesis in AI but can live with). If necessary, the company can also check the manuscriptbefore submission. But Aniket has to be able to have in the end a document that he can submit toTHWS as a certification of his work and use in the future as an example of his own scientific work,e.g. when searching for future jobs. This is an absolutely critical point but I hope this has been clear from the beginning - it is inthe end a Master thesis.An important point related to the above: as I have explained, we have now relaxed the rules for themanuscript itself from the hefty 80+ to  a lighter cca 20page jurnal-like format.", "source": "Thesis Regulations at Bosch.pdf", "page": 2}

In principle, thisshould make it easier for the company as well (shorter document to review). We, however, stillhave to be able to evaluate Aniket's work in terms of scientific contribution. This means that this20pages have to be very content heavy. If the code has to be left out, I am getting a little worriedhere. If there were even more restrictions on the content from the company side, e.g. leaving outanalytical results etc., I am afraid we would have to go back to the usual 80+ pages tocomplement the missing practical parts (due to being blocked by the company) with moretheoretical discussion and analysis and perhaps even experiments unrelated to the work in Bosch.For example, spiking neural networks are a topic on its own without any proprietary rights of theBosch consortia. If necessary, I could imagine Aniket working on this independent part of researchafter finishing his internship in Bosch and hence delivering the thesis quite a bit later. I would haveno problem with such a setup if it seemed easier for everybody involved. This is very much forAniket to consider and perhaps discuss with you.", "source": "Thesis Regulations at Bosch.pdf", "page": 2}

It is really important toavoid any misunderstandings on these points early on. Quite honestly, I am much less worried about the work itself than these legal proprietary stuff. It pains me that thereis still a great misalignment between company and academic interests complicating the opportunities for ourstudents.And yes, I do realize that you are just the poor PhD in the middle. :(Best[Quoted text hidden]Gregorová, Magda <magda.gregorova@thws.de>Wed, 26 Mar at 21:37To: Kulkarni, Aniket <aniketdattatraya.kulkarni@study.thws.de>, Shreya.Kshirasagar@de.bosch.com<Shreya.Kshirasagar@de.bosch.com>Cc: anikerry@gmail.com <anikerry@gmail.com>Hi all, on a more scientific and hence interesting note: I have remembered that there is a regular workshop on the topic atthe biggest European conference: https://sites.google.com/view/dlnh-ecmlpkdd24Perhaps there might be some interesting material to read :)Best[Quoted text hidden]", "source": "Thesis Regulations at Bosch.pdf", "page": 3}
